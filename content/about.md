# About Me

Hi, I’m Luiz, 23, a cybersecurity enthusiast who lives for Hack The Box, Hacking Club, and weekly CTF training.  

I used to dive deep into cryptography, but now my main focus is web security and blockchain. I hold certifications like: 
- PT1
- DCPT
- MCRTA
- CRTA  

When I’m not hacking, you’ll probably find me playing chess ♞, exploring new tech, or geeking out over security reports.
